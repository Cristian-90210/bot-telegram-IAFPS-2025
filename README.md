GENERAL OVERVIEW
</p><br></h1>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bot provides an interactive experience, guided by clear menus and intuitive buttons. The user is welcomed with an introductory message that explains the purpose of the application and how it is used, being directed to the main functionalities through a centralized menu.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Highlighted features in the interface:

Fuel Consumption Estimation – calculation of vehicle fuel consumption based on real parameters (model, engine, driving conditions, etc.)

About the Bot – detailed explanations regarding how it works, the algorithms used, and the factors taken into account

Suggestions – recommendations for fuel consumption optimization and efficient vehicle usage

Issue Reporting – dedicated channel for feedback and error reporting

Contact Information – details about the developer and support<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interface uses a modern dark-mode design, with suggestive visual elements (speedometer icon and car symbol), emphasizing clarity, readability, and ease of use.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The structure is optimized for fast mobile usage, specific to Telegram applications.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The project aims to provide a fuel consumption estimate as realistic as possible, going beyond the theoretical values offered by manufacturers, by integrating calculation and regression models adapted to real driving conditions.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h1><p align="center">
