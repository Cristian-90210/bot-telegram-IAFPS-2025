&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interface uses a modern dark-mode design, with suggestive visual elements (speedometer icon and car symbol), emphasizing clarity, readability, and ease of use.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The structure is optimized for fast mobile usage, specific to Telegram applications.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The project aims to provide a fuel consumption estimate as realistic as possible, going beyond the theoretical values offered by manufacturers, by integrating calculation and regression models adapted to real driving conditions.<br><br><br><br><br>
